# 100_python_100_days

This is a class I am taking right now.  I have used Python off and on over the years. This class goes into the latest ways to use Python. It starts with the simplest commands, but you start to build projects as the days go by.  By the end I will have an in depth knowledge on how to use Python and will use it as a backend.
